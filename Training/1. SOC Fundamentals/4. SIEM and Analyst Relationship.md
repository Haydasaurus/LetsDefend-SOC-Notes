### SIEM and Analyst Relationship

This will be generally about what SIEM is, why it is utilized within a SOC and the relationship between SIEM and a SOC analyst.

  
  

### What is SIEM?

Security information and event management (SIEM), is a security solution that provides the real time logging of events in an environment. The actual purpose for event logging is to detect security threats.

In general, SIEM products have a number of features. The ones that interest us most as SOC analysts are: they filter the data that they collect and create alerts for any suspicious events.

Example of an alert: If someone on a Windows operating system attempts to enter 20 incorrect passwords in 10 seconds, this is suspicious activity, it is not likely that someone who forgot their password would try to re-enter their password so many times in such a short period. This is why we create a SIEM rule/filter, to determine such activities that exceed the threshold values. Due to this SIEM rule an alert will be created if such a situation occurs.

Some popular SIEM solutions: IBM QRadar, ArcSight ESM, FortiSIEM, Splunk etc.

### Relationship Between a SOC Analyst and SIEM

Although SIEM solutions have many features, as SOC analysts we generally only follow alerts. There are other groups/people who develop configurations and rule correlations.

As we mentioned above, alerts are created by data that is passed through filters. The alerts are primarily analyzed by a SOC analyst. This is exactly where a SOC analyst’s duty in the security operations center begins. Fundamentally, he must decide whether this created alert is a real threat or a false alarm.

To better understand, let’s return to the “Monitoring” page, as you see below there are various alerts on the SIEM interface. As a SOC analyst we should analyze the details related to these alerts with the help of other SOC products (such as EDR, Log Management, Threat Intelligence Feed, etc.) and lastly we should determine whether or not they are real threats.

We can view newly created alerts in the “Main Channel”, we can think of this channel as a shared channel. Your teammates can not be seen in this simulation, but in an actual work situation your teammates will be able to view this panel. After you choose the alert you want to work on, click on the “Take Ownership” button in the area named “Action” to take ownership of the alert and direct it to the “Investigation Channel”. This way your teammates will be able to see which alert you are actively working on. At the same time, this will aid them in seeing which alert you are already working on so they can choose other alerts. This way your team can quickly examine all the alerts.

When you click on the alert you can see the related details. This way you can collect the information (hostname, IP address, file hash information, etc.) required for the investigation.

  
  

### Quick Tip

From time to time false alerts may occur in the SIEM. A good SOC Analyst would be able to determine such situations and give feedback to the team thereby contributing to the SOC team’s work efficiency.

  
  
**An example:**

Let’s assume that a SIEM team put together a rule set that created alerts for URL addresses that had the word “union” in them and tried to detect SQL Injections.  
A user did a search using “https://www.google.com/search?q=sql+union+usage”, an alert was created in the SIEM, it looks like there is no apparent danger. The alert was created because the keyword “union” was present in the URL. These kinds of exceptional situations can be communicated to the SIEM team to improve the alerting process.

  
  
**Final Words**

Up till now we have covered what SIEM is, what use it is to us as SOC Analysts and how we are required to utilize it. Further on in our program we will discuss how to analyze an alert created in the SIEM.
